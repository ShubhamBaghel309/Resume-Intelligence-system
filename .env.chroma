# ============================================================
# Chroma & HuggingFace Cache Configuration
# ============================================================
# 
# IMPORTANT: These settings ensure all model downloads and
# vector store data use D drive (not C drive which may be full)
#
# ChromaDB: Where vector embeddings are stored
# HuggingFace: Where AI models are cached
#
# NOTE: If you previously had CHROMA_DB_IMPL or 
# CHROMA_PERSIST_DIRECTORY set in your system environment,
# remove them to avoid migration warnings!
# ============================================================

# ✅ REMOVE THESE if set in your system environment:
# CHROMA_DB_IMPL=duckdb+parquet  (DEPRECATED - causes migration error)
# CHROMA_PERSIST_DIRECTORY=...   (DEPRECATED)

# ✅ USE THESE INSTEAD (handled in code):
# - Chroma data: storage/chroma
# - Model cache: storage/model_cache
# - HuggingFace cache: D:\cache\hugging_face (or as set below)

# HuggingFace model cache (for SentenceTransformers, etc.)
HF_HOME=D:\cache\hugging_face

# Disable symlink warnings on Windows
HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS_WARNING=1
